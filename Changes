version 0.003; 2017-07-31

    variant filename extension for loadable files

    material

  * in META.{yml,json}, point to public bug tracker

version 0.002; 2013-08-17

  * in the module used for testing, explicitly export symbols, and
    declare them at link time with dl_func_list, for those platforms
    that require it

version 0.001; 2012-02-07

  * duplicate small functions from Params::Classify and Module::Runtime,
    rather than importing from those modules, to avoid circular dependency
    problems (affecting both installation and runtime)

  * load modules Carp and DynaLoader lazily, to avoid excessive startup
    delay and potential circular dependencies

  * make the module used for testing more amenable to picky compilation
    toolchains

  * convert .cvsignore to .gitignore
